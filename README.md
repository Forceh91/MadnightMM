Madnight Mod Manager - Easily manage mods for games such as DiRT Rally

## Usage

The Madnight Mod Manager is a simple program that can be used to easily manage any mods for DiRT Rally such as car liveries. All you need to do is tell the mod manager where your mods are stored (in .zip files).

The mod manager will then do all the hard work for you, backing up your original files and swapping in the new files straight from the mod zip files.

## Aims

- Be light-weight
- Be open-source
- Be simple

## Basic todos

1. Check each .zip file and store a list of each file (including directory/extension) that it contains
2. Back up the original files from the game's directory
3. Put the mod files into the game's directory in the correct directories
